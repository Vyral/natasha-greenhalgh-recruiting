<center>As a real estate agent, it&rsquo;s important to practice things like role playing and scripts so that you can be more effective as a salesperson. Here&rsquo;s a quick look at some of the things we do.</center>

&nbsp;

To us in our real estate business, “practice makes perfect” means a lot of things. For example, we do script and role play practice on a daily basis so that we have a smooth delivery while prospecting and to ensure that we have the exact words to say in any situation.

Many of us played team sports growing up and focused all of our energy into getting better over the course of the season. **What I’ve found is that we often spend more time watching and analyzing game film around our high school sports than we do on our profession as a real estate agent.**

For those of you watching today, what film are you watching? Not in the literal sense, but are you going back and reviewing your listing presentation? Are you role playing regularly? **Oftentimes, what you think you’re saying and what you’re actually saying aren't always the same.**

It really helps to have a partner in a situation like this who can critique you, keep you on track, and help you make things feel more natural on the phone and in person. **Practice makes perfect, and forming habits like this essential to having success in this business.**

If you have any questions for us in the meantime about your real estate career or about business in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
