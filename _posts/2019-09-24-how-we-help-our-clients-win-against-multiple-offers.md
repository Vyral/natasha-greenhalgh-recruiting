{% include youtube.html %}Competing against multiple offers can be stressful for homebuyers, but we have the experience and knowledge to help our clients always come out on top.&nbsp;

Over the years, we’ve been in many multiple-offer scenarios, and we’ve consistently been able to come out ahead.

**It all starts with setting the correct expectations with our buyers,** letting them know about the market we’re in, and what it will look like when we find the perfect home. Writing the offer and getting it accepted only gives us the opportunity to purchase the property, so we’re going to write offers.

Next, we contact the listing agent, let them know about our buyers, why they love the home, and find out what’s important to the seller in an offer.

It’s important to come in strong with a great pre-qualification letter or proof of funds. **If you don’t have them, it might as well not be an offer.** Upping the earnest money is smart too, because it doesn’t cost buyers any extra and makes them look a lot stronger. You can also alter contingencies based on the seller’s needs.&nbsp;

**Starting at 2:23 in the video above, you can see an example of how we reach out to listing agents to get information about their sellers and the offers they have on their home.**

If you have any questions for us in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We’d love to talk to you more about the scripts and dialogues we use on our team, or anything else about the real estate business. We look forward to speaking with you soon.
