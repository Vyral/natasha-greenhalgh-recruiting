<center>What can agents do to boost their shot of securing a successful appraisal? Follow these steps.&nbsp;</center>

&nbsp;

With prices rising in our market, there have been some strange appraisal issues showing up as of late. Thankfully, there are a few ways you can prepare for an appraisal to make sure it’s as accurate as possible.&nbsp;

First, listing agents need to have comps that support their asking price. **If there are no comps available, don’t send out anything.&nbsp;**

It’s also a good idea to meet with appraisers in person while they’re visiting the property. This will give you the opportunity to provide them with a “sales pitch” of sorts. You should include comps (if you have any), home features, and other evidence of the property’s value during this pitch so as to best illustrate your point.&nbsp;

When you’ve finished with this meeting, don’t forget to leave your card with the appraiser and let them know that they can reach out to you if they’ve got a problem with the value. **Establishing a relationship with the appraiser is a great pre-emptive step to take.**

Not only will taking these steps help boost your chances of a successful appraisal, but letting buyers and sellers know that you offer this kind of advocacy can be a great boon to your business. **Clients love to know that you’re a strong negotiator.&nbsp;**
