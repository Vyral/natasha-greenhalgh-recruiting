<center>If you want to make your listing presentation dazzle, follow these three tips.&nbsp;</center>

&nbsp;

Here are three important tips to remember if you want to make your very best listing presentation:

**1\. Have a professionally printed presentation.** You want something that looks impressive. In addition to being a leave-behind document, it should also be able to prompt you through your presentation. If you want a cheaper option, you can make a digital alternative on your tablet or laptop.&nbsp;

**2\. Know your numbers and your neighborhood.** Come prepared with the comps and neighborhood activity, because potential sellers know their neighborhood well—probably better than you do. They’ve visited Zillow, talked with their neighbors, attended open houses, etc. You don’t want to be caught *not* knowing what they know. A good tip I recommend (that I do as well) is to show up to the neighborhood 15 minutes early and search for any “For Sale” signs and what those houses are listed for.&nbsp;

**3\. Ask the seller what the three most important things they want to get out of the presentation are.** This will prevent you from losing their attention and help you focus on what’s most important to them.&nbsp;
