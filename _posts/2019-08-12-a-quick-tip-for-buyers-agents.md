I was out showing properties recently and wanted to share a quick tip for all the buyer’s agents out there. We know we have to jump on properties the minute they come on the market because a lot of times we’re in multiple-offer situations. I recommend giving a quick call to the listing agent before you make an offer. It might seem simple, but it will help you write a solutions-based offer that the seller is eager to accept. Find out what’s important to the seller and make sure to put that in the offer. If you have any other questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
