All too often, agents looking to succeed in the industry focus their energy in the wrong places. They look for quick fixes instead of seeking out real solutions. With that in mind, it’s no wonder why so many Realtors fail.

To help you steer clear of this same fate, today we’d like to share a few tips and tricks for launching (or relaunching) your own career in real estate.

The first tip on our list is quite simple: **You’ve got to treat real estate like a real business.** This may sound obvious, but many agents get started in real estate because they want to escape the doldrums of a typical nine-to-five lifestyle. While getting into real estate can give you a lot of personal freedom in your career, it’s important not to conflate this freedom for a lack of responsibility.&nbsp;

You need to hold yourself accountable and truly commit yourself to working on dollar-producing activities consistently each day. A good way to achieve this is by time blocking—which means dividing your day into a series of tasks to be completed within specific “blocks” of time.

With that said, **time blocking is actually our second tip.** Every agent’s schedule will vary slightly, but we highly recommend dedicating the first time block of each day toward lead generation. Consistent communication with prospective clients is crucial, and the more personal this contact is, the better.&nbsp;

The most intimate communication strategies are also the most effective. This means you should prioritize face-to-face meetings over phone calls, phone calls over text messages, and text messages over emails when reaching out to potential clients.&nbsp;

The third tactic we recommend when launching or relaunching your career in real estate is to **reconnect with your sphere of influence.** Most agents’ first deals come from people who already know, like, and trust them. Sometimes, converting a lead out of your sphere of influence can be as simple as telling the people in your life about your decision to enter the industry. This can spark a conversation about their goals, and the rest is history.&nbsp;
