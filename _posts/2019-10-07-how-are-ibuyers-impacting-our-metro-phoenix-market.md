<center>In our Phoenix area market, iBuyers have become increasingly prevalent. Today, let&rsquo;s discuss how agents should respond to this growing trend.</center>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

These days, iBuyers have become a hot topic in our metro Phoenix area market; **but what are iBuyers, and what impact have they had on local real estate?** Allow us to explain.

First of all, an iBuyer is essentially a real estate investment company that will make an outright, all-cash offer on a seller’s home. These companies claim that the experience of selling to them is more convenient than listing on the open market. And this isn’t a new phenomenon. Remember those “We Buy Houses” signs you still sometimes see along the side of the street? The companies that put those up are iBuyers.&nbsp;

**Here in Phoenix, sales to iBuyers represent 5% to 6% of all transactions every month.** This is more iBuyer activity than in the Dallas, Orlando, and Raleigh markets combined. But does this prevalence mean agents should be fighting against iBuyers?&nbsp;

Actually, no. The key is to learn how to develop a strategy for working alongside iBuyers and incorporating them into your business.&nbsp;
