Today we’re excited to talk to you about your sphere of influence. Over the years, we’ve both learned that the No. 1 source of business for real estate professionals should be from those individuals who know, like and trust them, aka their “sphere.”

**At Home Helper Consultants, we like to implement a touch campaign for each person in our SOI.** We touch them intentionally 21 times per year through a mix of texts, phone calls, emails, personal meetings, and more.&nbsp;

If you fail to interact with them every few weeks, individuals will fail to recognize you or refer your business. What we’ve done is come up with a system of frequent interactions.&nbsp;

**We’re not as much focused on the content as we are about consistency and frequency.** The intentional activity behind it is what creates business.

If you’re a real estate agent, you probably have your name, phone number, and title in your signature. You don’t have to run around and ask everyone who they know who wants to buy and sell as long as you’re making frequent touches.

One thing we do is called Friendsday Wednesday. This week, we’re writing personalized notes every day to people in our SOI. I have one gal who is writing a joke, and that’s the only thing that she’s putting. No business card, no ad. The endgame is to have people think about you when they think about real estate.

The more intimate an interaction you have with a prospect in your SOI, the higher the rate of success. Ultimately, our SOI interactions always lead to a conversation or face-to-face meeting, the most intimate interaction you can have. From there it goes phone call, text, note card, and email. **The higher you can climb on this ladder, the more likely that you’ll see success when it comes to converting new business.**

If you have any questions for us in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
