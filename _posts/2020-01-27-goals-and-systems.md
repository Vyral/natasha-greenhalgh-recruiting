{% include youtube.html %}<center>We’re discussing how to set goals and put systems in place to help you achieve them.</center> 

Today we’re discussing goals and systems. **Many of us set goals but never bother to put a system in place to ensure we achieve them.** Here’s an idea: What if you didn’t even set a short-term goal? What if you just put a ton of systems in place, and did certain actions consistently?&nbsp;

For example, if your goal is to go to the gym four days a week, but you don’t put a system in place, you may never attain that goal. However, if your system involves being physically active (or engaging in a certain physical activity) every single day, you’ll likely end up doing more in the long run than what you would have done at the gym four times a week.&nbsp;

What we’re really discussing is the formation of habits. Developing systems is essentially the creation of habits by repeating constructive actions that lead to the fulfillment of your goals. Doing something consistently over a short period builds a habit.&nbsp;

So, **if you want to be successful in real estate, form habits around what the best agents do.** Successful agents lead generate, they’re consistent, they follow up with their database and SOI, they show up to work every day, and they treat their job like a profession. Apply this to your business. Set goals, but design systems for achieving them.&nbsp;
