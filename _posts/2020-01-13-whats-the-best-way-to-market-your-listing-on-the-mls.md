What’s the best way to market your listing on the MLS?

First, remember that **the way people view homes is completely different than it was just a few years ago.** Properties are now marketed directly to the consumer instead of real estate agents, so you need to make sure your listing hits the market at the right time, has very good photos (the most important must show up first), and has a brief-but-informative description that captures buyers’ attention.&nbsp;

What qualifies as your listing’s most important photos is something you must decide. What are the home’s best features? Does it have an amazing view? How about a beautiful pool? Like we said, the pictures that captivate people should show up first. In other words, if a random buyer is on their laptop clicking through properties on Zillow, your listing’s first picture should catch their eye. They may click through the next three or four pictures, but they won’t click through picture No. 78.

We see a lot of listings whose descriptions are unnecessarily wordy, but there are a few tips to remember to keep your listing’s description succinct. The first sentence should describe the home like a marketing headline would. After that, don’t repeat obvious details. Describe what’s important about it and what buyers will like when they visit it.&nbsp;

We take this subject seriously. The truth of the matter is that **nine out of every 10 homes we sell are sold on the MLS,** meaning other agents are selling them for us. That’s why marketing your listing on the MLS is so important.&nbsp;
