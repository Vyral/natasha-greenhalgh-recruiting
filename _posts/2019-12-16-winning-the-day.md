&nbsp;

How do you know if you’re winning the day?

To judge their success, real estate agents often look at lag measures (i.e., closings). Closings can take weeks (or even months) to accomplish, though, so what about today? **Here are the factors we look at on our team to know if our agents are winning the day.&nbsp;**

The first is whether they show up on time for our morning meetings, script practices, role-play sessions, and other events that start the day. The second is whether they’ve set aside time for lead generation and outbound prospecting.&nbsp;

No matter what your method of lead generation is, we believe there’s one metric that determines your success: **the number of daily contacts you make.** Closings are a result of listings taken, which themselves are the result of appointments converted. The only way you get appointments is by adding to your database, and the only way you add to your database is to make contacts.&nbsp;

So, to really know whether you’ve won the day, define how many contacts you must have on a daily basis.&nbsp;
