<center>Here are three tips to help you learn and remember people&rsquo;s names.</center>

&nbsp;

Being able to remember people’s names is an important skill in the real estate industry, it’s not something that comes naturally to everyone. We often think so hard about how we’re going to talk to clients about prices, objections, etc., that we forget to even do proper introductions. But beyond what information we provide to clients, we also need to consider how we make them feel. Today I’ll let Natasha educate us all with helpful tips to better recall the names of people we meet in the business.

1. **Be aware of how important it is for people to hear their own names. **
2. **Repeat their name back to them when they introduce themselves.**
3. **Associate the names you hear with other people you’re familiar with, like a family member or even a celebrity.**

We can all agree that it’s important to build relationships with our clients, and this starts with knowing their name and continues with getting to know them on a deeper level.

If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out and give us a call. We hope to hear from you soon\!
