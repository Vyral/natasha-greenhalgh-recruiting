<center>How can you become your clients&rsquo; economist of choice? Find out today.</center>

&nbsp;

Our team takes pride in understanding what’s going on in our community and the economy as a whole. **Here’s a list of some of the tools and resources we’ve incorporated into our business so that we’re more knowledgeable than our competition when it comes to meeting with a buyer or seller:**

* [Morning Brew.](https://www.morningbrew.com/) By subscribing to the Morning Brew, you can receive daily updates about what’s going on in the world of business, including both general and specific facts as well as local and global news. Morning brew keeps you up to date on financial trends, housing market developments, and news that particularly affects our industry.

* [Wall Street Journal.](https://www.wsj.com/) You can’t read all the articles on the WSJ unless you subscribe to it, but you don’t need to subscribe in order to read some news on their website. Just reading the headlines at least gives me a working knowledge of what’s going on in the world—I can just do research on those topics that pique my interests.
* [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com). On CNBC’s website, they have a section specifically for real estate. You don’t need to subscribe to have access to all their real estate news, and they do a very good job of detailing what’s happening in the housing market.
* [Phoenix Business Journal](https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/). This weekly journal does require a subscription, but as one of the resources I use to keep myself apprised of what’s happening in our metro area, I highly recommend it to you. More than just commercial or residential real estate, the Journal also has news about the latest developments in technology and business.

**If you’re looking to become more informed on the goings-on of the real estate and economic industries, I recommend that you look through the above resources and find out which ones work the best for you so you can integrate them into your morning routine.** If you turn educating yourself into a habit, you’ll become more knowledgeable than your competition and better able to help your clients make informed decisions.
