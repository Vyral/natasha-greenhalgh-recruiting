<p>Dear Fellow Real Estate Agent:</p>

<p>We understand that you may be working at a real estate brokerage or on a traditional team as part of someone else’s personal brand. Perhaps you’re just getting started in your career, but feel as if your current path isn’t leading you to the success you deserve. Or maybe you’ve got some experience under your belt already, but are still not making the kind of income you imagined you would. </p>

<p>Working in these environments can be discouraging. <strong>You fall in line only to find that you’re not moving forward—you’re just spinning your wheels.</strong> Agents at most brokerages receive very little income, support, or training. The truth is that 87% of agents will fail within their first five years in the industry. They give their all only to eventually leave the business and land themselves in a nine to five job where they’re barely scraping by. </p>

<p>And many of the agents who do continue working in market aren’t much better off. These agents resort to pleading with friends and family, hoping someone they know personally will hire them. But then, inevitably, they’ll run out of people to talk to. These agents lack a lead generation plan, and are therefore left to hope that their next client will fall out of the sky. <strong>Many new agents underestimate the difficulties of the industry,</strong> and, unfortunately, few agents are adequately prepared for the demands of the job.</p>

<p>It’s no wonder that so many agents don’t make it. <strong>Proper sales training is a rare thing in our business.</strong> Not to mention that most agents are left with meager paychecks even after all of their best efforts. On top of that, the money agents are left with is often improperly allocated across their resources. It becomes a vicious cycle.</p>

<p>With all of these issues weighing you down, you’ve found yourself up at 3 a.m. wondering where your career is headed. You’ve also probably tried a number of solutions with no luck. If what I’ve been describing sounds familiar, I’ve got good news. <strong>My name is Natasha Greenhalgh, and since starting with Keller Williams Realty in 2005, I’ve helped many agents just like you get on the path for success in real estate.</strong> </p>

<p>Our agents have sold thousands of homes using our proven systems, and we’d like you to join us as we continue selling even more. Homehelper Consultants has been listed among Phoenix’s top 10, and the nation’s top 250, performing teams for several years now. We’ve been so successful, in fact, that the same models we use to drive our business are currently being taught across the country to other aspiring teams. </p>

<p>Homehelper Consultants invests in its agents’ success. We offer:
<ul class="indent">
<li>Coaching from our full-time sales team leader</li>
<li>Support from our full-time administrative staff</li>
<li>Access to top marketing resources, which we spend $100,000 on per year</li>
<li>Peer accountability</li>
<li>Leads</li>
<li>And much more! </li>
</ul></p>

<p>We are so confident in our systems that we offer every new agent a <strong>$75,000 income guarantee</strong>—no strings attached. If you perform to our team’s standards and honor our model each day, you will make $75,000 in your first year, or we’ll pay you the difference. </p>

<p>When you join us, your path to success starts right away. We’ll send you through our intensive onboarding system, get you involved in our Sphere in Gear campaign, and immerse you into our company culture. </p>

<p>Our support-oriented environment helps professionals learn, grow, and thrive. <strong>People join our team because they want to succeed, make money, and serve our community.</strong> We understand that to reach those goals, you need support, coaching, resources, and leads—so that is exactly what we provide.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the fate of your career is in your hands. You can try to go it alone as a solo agent, continue struggling at your current brokerage or team, or you can join us, plug in to our systems, and start seeing the success you deserve. <strong>We’re looking for a very select group of smart, detail-oriented, full-time agents to join us at our next agent start group.</strong> </p>

<p>In the face of the current market shift, this opportunity could not come at a better time, so don’t let it pass you by. The longer you wait to reach out, the more likely you’ll be left to weather the coming downturn without the proper tools or support. So reach out today. </p>

<p>We take agents and turn them into business professionals. We’re offering you success, very competitive compensation, and the ability to have a great balance between your life and your work. When you apply with us, you are taking advantage of the opportunity to truly fulfill your potential. </p>

<p>I’m looking forward to talking to you soon!</p>
