<p>You are also welcome to subscribe to our Agent Training Podcast on iTunes and we also publish our free training content on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HomehelperConsultants/" target="_blank">local Facebook page</a> if you prefer to stay in touch that way, too.<p>

<p>Most importantly, everything you receive is designed to start a conversation. So, if you have any questions about selling real estate you can email me at <a href="mailto:natasha@homehelperconsultants.com">natasha@homehelperconsultants.com</a>.</p>

<p>I’ll first answer your question by email, and if I think it would be of benefit to more people, I’ll answer it in a video.</p>

<p>We look forward to staying in touch. Let’s raise the standard and training of all real estate agents in the Phoenix area.</p>
